# fractal_curves
Each `.py` file with the name f a fractal is a piece of code where the points that compose the given fracal curve are computed for each step of the constructing algorithm. For each file, the link to the fractal wikipedia page is given (top multiline comment) to help understand the transformations operated on the points.
All such file have the exact same construction pattern and function names nomenclatures. I may create a code that will generate these file automatically from the bare necessities (i.e. the curve name and the function that gives the new points for a given edge)

The `display.py` file is used only to have better display and for code clarity.
